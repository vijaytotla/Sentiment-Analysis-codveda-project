# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

This project analyzes a **social media sentiment dataset** using Python and Power BI to uncover emotional patterns, user engagement, and platform behavior across posts.

---

## Dataset Used

- **Name**: `Sentiment dataset.csv`
- **Columns**:
  - `timestamp`: When the post was made
  - `text`: The actual post content
  - `sentiment`: Emotion category (e.g., Joy, Frustration, Positive)
  - `likes`, `retweets`: Engagement metrics
  - `platform`, `country`, `user`: Metadata

---

## Project Objectives

- Understand the **distribution of emotions** expressed in posts
- Compare **engagement levels** (likes/retweets) across platforms
- Visualize **posting trends by time**
- Reveal **frequent words** used under each sentiment (via NLP)
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard**

---

## Python (Preprocessing & NLP)

Before visualization, the dataset was cleaned and enriched using Python:
- Removed duplicates and filled missing values
- Standardized sentiment labels
- Tokenized text and counted word frequency
- Generated:
  - `sentiment_cleaned.csv` (used in Power BI)
  - Word cloud images (per sentiment)
  - Bar charts of top words per emotion
